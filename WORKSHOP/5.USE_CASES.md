## 1 Learning about the project, onboarding
### Use Case 1: Understanding Authentication Flow
- How does authentication work in this application?
- Give me some test usernames and passwords

### Use Case 2: Project Structure Overview
- What's the main structure of this application?
- How are components organized?

### Use Case 3: Database Schema Discovery
- What database tables and relationships exist in this application?

## 2 Requirements / tasks analysis / Estimations
### Use Case 1: Feature Analysis and Estimation

- @workspace Analyze the task in #file:5a.EXAMPLE_TASK.md , and create clear explanation of task (highlight points which require clarification, do not make assumptions)
- For every point requiring clarification give your suggestion
- Thatis fine. Create a detailed breakdown of these tasks in #file:TASKS.md file
- Estimate each small task and give total estimation for an average full-stack senior software engineer

## 3 System Design (architecture, libraries, solutions)
- #fetch Search for opensource api's for exchange rates and pick the best one.
- what's the best solution for caching currency exchange rates?
 
## 4 Creating new components
- #file:5a.EXAMPLE_TASK.md #file:TASKS.md Now begin implementing the solution for exchange rates task by task.
