## 1 Learning about the project, onboarding
### Use Case 1: Understanding Authentication Flow
- How does authentication work in this application?
- Give me some test usernames and passwords

### Use Case 2: Project Structure Overview
- What's the main structure of this application?
- How are components organized?

### Use Case 3: Database Schema Discovery
- What database tables and relationships exist in this application?

## 2 Requirements / tasks analysis / Estimations
### Use Case 1: Feature Analysis and Estimation

- @workspace Analyze the task in #file:5a.EXAMPLE_TASK.md , and create clear explanation of task (highlight points which require clarification, do not make assumptions)
- For every point requiring clarification give your suggestion
- Thatis fine. Create a detailed breakdown of these tasks in #file:TASKS.md file
- Estimate each small task and give total estimation for an average full-stack senior software engineer

## 3 System Design (architecture, libraries, solutions)
- #fetch Search for opensource api's for exchange rates and pick the best one.
- what's the best solution for caching currency exchange rates?

## 4 Creating new components
- #file:5a.EXAMPLE_TASK.md #file:TASKS.md Now begin implementing the solution for exchange rates task by task.

## 5 Coding (algorithms, regexp, validation, error handling, queries etc.)
- Write an SQL query to get all users who have not logged in for the last 30 days.
- Write an Mondoshel query to get total sums of all transactions for all users in the last 30 days.
- Write a regex to find all users with 'John' as part of name or last name. Regexp for Typecript

## 6 Documenting
- Write a documentation for the new feature in #file:CURRENCY_FEATURE.md. Use beatiful markdown and include examples.
- Comment the code in #file:5a.EXAMPLE_TASK.md and #file:TASKS.md files. Use clear and simple language.
- Add JSDoc comments to the functions in #file:5a.EXAMPLE_TASK.md and #file:TASKS.md files. Use clear and simple language.

## 7 Unit testing / E2E testing (including mock data generation, edge cases)
- Write unit tests for the function in #file:5a.EXAMPLE_TASK.md and #file:TASKS.md files. Use clear and simple language.
- Write E2E tests for the new feature in #file:CURRENCY_FEATURE.md. Use clear and simple language.

## 8 Code reviews
- Review the code in #changes. Point out errors, code smells, performace issues, security issues, and suggest improvements.
- Review the code in #changes. Check if this code won't have breaking changes.
- Review the code in #changes. If current version is 1.2.0, suggest a new version number according to semantic versioning.

## 9 Troubleshooting / debugging / bug fixing
- I see that avatars are not displayed. Please fix it.
- When I'm in my account page, i see that in text inputs all code is too close to the left border. fix it

## 10 Refactoring
Switch to branch 10_refactoring
- The performance of the app is too low. Check the code in #file:5a.EXAMPLE_TASK.md and #file:TASKS.md files and suggest improvements.
- The #database file is too big. Refactor it to make it smaller and more readable. (EXAMPLE OF PUBLIC CODE)

## 11 Deployment
TBD
