# GitHub Copilot Limitations

> ⚠️ Important considerations when using GitHub Copilot

## Key Limitations

1. **Limited Context Awareness**
   - Auto-complete functionality is limited to current and open files (Plans exist to extend to full codebase analysis)

2. **Code Quality Concerns**
   - May suggest irrelevant, non-compiling, or outdated code, so user review is essential

3. **Security and Performance**
   - Test code strictly, as suggestions can be unoptimized or insecure

4. **Developer Impact**
   - Might distract coders
   - Can foster bad habits, especially for beginners

5. **Long-term Considerations**
   - Overreliance can hinder developer growth
   - Raises copyright concerns
