# Best Practices

- **Keep files under 500 lines.**  
  Split into modules when needed.

- **Start fresh conversations often.**  
  Long threads degrade response quality.

- **One task per message.**  
  Don’t overload the model.

- **Test early, test often.**  
  Every new function should have unit tests.

- **Be specific in your requests.**  
  The more context, the better. Examples help a lot.

- **Write docs and comments as you go.**  
  Don’t delay documentation.

- **Implement environment variables yourself.**  
  Don’t trust the LLM with API keys.

- **Manually set includes/imports or module references.**  
  Especially when using a specific package version.

- **Use clear variable and function names.**  
  Avoid generic names like `foo` or `bar`.

- **Provide sample code when possible.**
