# EXAMPLE TASK EXTENDED

Multi-Currency Support - Detailed Task Description
Task Overview
Implement a feature that allows users to view transaction amounts in different currencies (USD, GBP, and EUR) by clicking on any transaction amount and selecting their desired currency for on-demand conversion.

Business Value
Enhance user experience for international customers
Provide flexibility for users who work with multiple currencies
Support global financial awareness without requiring permanent settings changes
Detailed Requirements

1. Transaction Amount Click Interaction
Make all transaction amounts throughout the app clickable
When clicked, display a currency selector popup with USD, GBP, and EUR options
Convert and display the amount in the selected currency immediately
2. Currency Conversion
Implement real-time exchange rate service for USD, GBP, and EUR
Cache exchange rates to minimize API calls
Include fallback rates in case of API failures
All backend data remains in USD; conversions are for display only
3. Currency Display
Show appropriate currency symbols ($ for USD, £ for GBP, € for EUR)
Format numbers according to currency conventions (commas, periods)
Briefly indicate when a conversion has been applied
4. UI Components
Create a reusable currency selection popup component
Implement a money display component that supports all three currencies
Ensure the popup appears in the correct position relative to the clicked amount
5. User Experience
Make currency selection persistent within a session
Provide visual feedback during conversion
Ensure popup doesn't disrupt page layout or other interactions
6. Testing
Add unit tests for currency conversion logic
Test popup positioning and interaction
Verify correct number formatting for each currency
Technical Considerations
Use a reliable exchange rate API (e.g., ExchangeRate-API)
Implement proper error handling for API failures
Cache exchange rates to minimize API calls
Ensure responsive design works on all device sizes
