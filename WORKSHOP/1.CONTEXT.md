# Understanding Context in GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot's effectiveness heavily depends on the context it receives. There are two main types of context:

1. **File Context**: Copilot analyzes:
   - Currently open files
   - Related files in your workspace
   - File structure and dependencies
   - Code patterns and conventions used in your project

2. **Prompt Context**: The way you phrase your requests matters:
   - Be specific about what you want to achieve
   - Mention relevant technical details
   - Include any constraints or requirements
   - Reference existing code or patterns when relevant
   - Add additional context by providing links and files with necessary information

**NB**: You should be aware about the model's cutoff date. Every model is trained on data up to a specific moment in time, so it may not be aware of the latest libraries, frameworks, or best practices that have emerged since then. Provide documentation context for best results.s

The more relevant context Copilot has, the more accurate and project-aligned its suggestions will be. It adapts its recommendations based on your project's coding style, patterns, and requirements.
