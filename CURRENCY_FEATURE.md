# Currency Exchange Rate Feature

## Overview
The Currency Exchange Rate feature provides real-time exchange rate information for USD, EUR, and GBP currencies. This enhances the user experience by allowing users to stay informed about current exchange rates while using the application.

## Components

### 1. Exchange Rate Service
The exchange rate service handles fetching, caching, and providing currency exchange rates.

- **API Provider**: ExchangeRate-API (https://open.er-api.com)
- **Refresh Rate**: Data updates every 30 seconds in the UI
- **Caching**: Rates are cached for 1 hour to reduce API calls
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Provides fallback rates if the API is unavailable

### 2. Currency Rate Widget
A compact widget displayed at the top of the transaction pages, showing current exchange rates for USD, EUR, and GBP.

Features:
- Real-time exchange rates
- Visual indicators (up/down arrows) for rate changes
- Last update timestamp
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Current Exchange Rates
The widget automatically displays at the top of the transaction pages:
- Public transactions
- Friends transactions
- Personal transactions

Example display:
```
Exchange Rates   USD 1.0000   EUR 0.9234 ↑   GBP 0.7921 ↓
Updated: 10:45 AM
```

### API Service Usage
The Exchange Rate Service can be imported and used in other components:

```typescript
import { getExchangeRates, convertCurrency } from '../services/exchangeRateService';

// Get current exchange rates
const rates = await getExchangeRates();

// Convert 100 USD to EUR
const amountInEUR = convertCurrency(100, 'USD', 'EUR', rates);
```

## Future Enhancements
As part of the Multi-Currency Support initiative, this feature will be expanded to:

1. Allow users to set their preferred display currency
2. Show transaction amounts in the user's preferred currency
3. Support additional currencies beyond USD, EUR, and GBP
4. Provide historical exchange rate data for transaction histories

## Technical Implementation
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety
- React hooks manage component state and side effects
- Efficient caching minimizes API calls
- Error handling with fallback values ensures reliability
